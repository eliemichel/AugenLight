Augen Light
===========

### About

This is an OpenGL 4.5 Core "hello triangle" code using GLFW and glad. It includes the typical folder layout and CMakeLists that I use for larger projects.

The C++ code of the program is located in [`src/AugenLight`](src/AugenLight) and in particular [`src/AugenLight/main.cpp`](src/AugenLight/main.cpp) is a fully commented sample explaining the use of a VBO, a VAO and a shader program to render a dynamic scene.

### Building

This is a standard CMake project. You can check out the build scripts for further building information, or simply the appropriate one.
